#   HW2 Assignment 
#   Author: Ann-Elizabeth Le

#   -------
#   Part 1: Patterns
#   -------

#   1) Write a function that given two integers, prints out two identical recentagles
#   of width n and height m, separated by an empty column with '*'
def rectangle(n, m):
    pass


#   2) Write a function that given a positive integer n, prints out a triangle of height n with '*'
#   The triangle should follow the rules:
#   (a) Each row at depth i, i >0 has two more stars than the number of stars of the previous row at depth i-1 
#   (b) At depth 0, the function prints 1 star
def triangle(n):
    pass


#   -------
#   Part 2: Function on lists
#   -------

#   Write a function that takes a list of integers aList as argument
#   and returns a new list where multiple occurrences of values have been removed.
def clean1(aList):
    pass



#   -------
#   Part 3: Function on lists 
#   -------

#   Write a function that takes a list of integers aList as argument and modifies this list
#   and does not return a list.
def clean2(aList):
    pass




#   -------
#   Part 4: Function on lists
#   -------

#   Write a function that takes a list of integers aList as arguments
#   and returns a string containing elements of the list that are not a power of 2, all on the same line
#   Write a call to this function with arguments embedded in a print statement
def fct(aList):
    pass



#   -------
#   Part 5: Taylor Sinus 
#   -------

#   Write a function that approximates the sin(x) by
#   returning the sum of the first n elements of its Taylor series
def taylor(x,n):
    pass






#   ------------
#   Extra credit
#   ------------

#   Implement a function that takes a list of integers as argument
#   and return the max number of consecutive integers that are all equal witin this list
def consecutives(aList):
    pass
